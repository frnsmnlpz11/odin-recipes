        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4&#188; cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups pork spare rib cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 pc red onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 pcs medium sized tomato, quartered</li>
            <li>8 pcs sitaw, sliced into 2‚Äù pieces</li>
            <li>250 g kangkong stalk and leaves</li>
            <li>1 pc talong, sliced</li>
            <li>2 pcs siling pangsigang</li>
            <li>1 (20g) pack Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original</li>
            <li>Optional: labanos, okra</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place
                pork
                ribs submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water.<br>
                Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to float to the surface. Meticulously remove
                the
                scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a spatula.<br>
                Scums are impurities found in meat.
            </li>
            <li>After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it's time toss in your onions and
                tomatoes
                to add flavor to the broth.<br>
                Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat so that the
                flavors
                would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs,<br>
                You also do this so you can tell if it's already set and tender.</li>
            <li>You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot
                and
                cook until these turn dark green.<br>
                If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This should take roughly
                around
                2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add water, whole pepper corn, and dried bay leaves then bring to a boil.<br>
                Simmer for 40 minutes to 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it
                simmer.
                It should be done in about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a happy treat that warms, soothes and
                satisfies
                everyone in the family!<br>
                Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this Filipino classic
                soup. Enjoy!</li>
